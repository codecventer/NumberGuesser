# NumberGuesser

This C# application asks the user to guess the correct number between 1-10. The app generates a new number each round and provides a success message once the user has chosen the correct number. The app will then ask the user if they would like to play again.

# What I Learned

- Generating a new random number.
- Loops and user input.
- Both 'error' and 'success' messages assigned to specific entries or answers.
